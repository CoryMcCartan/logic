variables stored on HEAP.  HEAP_PTR points to beginning of free memory.

Variables take up one cell.  First part of cell stores enum of type (REF),
second stores pointer to the cell itself (or first instance of this variable,
in the case of repeats).

Structures take up n+2 cells.  First cell is like a variable cell, with tag
(STR) and pointer to the 'functor cell'.  The functor cell stores the
representation of the functor, which is the unique ID of the struct, and its
arity.  Immediately following the functor cell are n cells
